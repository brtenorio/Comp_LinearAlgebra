# Comp_LinearAlgebra

Comp_LinearAlgebra is a repository of Python codes that I produced as projects for a course on Computational Linear Algebra that I attended in 2016 as part of my master degree, offered by the graduate program of computer science at UFRJ. 

The projects are very old (run on python2.7) but good to remember old times :)
